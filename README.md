## 1800 Numbers

These **toll free** numbers allow customers to reach a business without being charged for the call. Typically, 1800 numbers are free to call from landlines, but not from mobile phones.

These are so-called **local call** numbers that allow customers to call businesses at the cost of a local call. However, a mobile call is billed at a rate that is determined by their mobile service provider.

## 13 numbers

These are the same as the 1300 numbers.
